    <p>Hi there! I'm Nathan, a Data Scientist with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from BINUS University. I will be pursuing my postgraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Hong Kong (HKU).</p>
    <p>My interests include machine learning, quantitative finance, and building data-driven solutions that bridge theory and practice. I am currently undergoing research in quantitative finance, focusing on the application of machine learning and statistics in financial modeling and analysis.</p>
    <p>Outside of work and research, I'm passionate about cars and motorcycles‚ÄîI love riding and exploring new roads whenever I get the chance. I also enjoy diving and have started exploring the underwater world, with a growing interest in discovering more dive sites.</p>
